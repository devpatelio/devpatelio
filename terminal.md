**DOKTOR I ‚Üí** *Diagnostics Tool for Patients with Range of Serverity for Diabetic Retinopathy Using Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks* [Nov 2020-Jan-2021]

Developed a deep learning computer vision algorithm that rivaled the test and train accuracy of traditional ophthalmologists by 35.4% on national average. The system is built using preprocessed training data of patients with several levels of diabetic retinopathy in severity (No-DR to Proliferate-DR) and accurately diagnose the level of severity early on. It can also make specific predictions for patients with little to no DR to collect more long-term snapshots of diabetic patients. Used a resenet with elements of transfer learning, trained on the GPU ‚Üí **Validation accuracy of 80.45%** ‚Üí clinical diagnostics aim to alleviate much of the burdgen with early diagnostics. 

***Core Tech:  PyTorch, Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Azure***

**Instacart Data Gaps and Customer Experience ‚Üí** *Building a better data management and infra solution for Instacart product catalogues and feature expansion through the shopper app* [Oct 2020 - Dec 2020]

With the objective of proposing solutions to improve the Instacart customer experience, led a team to develop solutions aimed at solving Instacart data catalogue issues in order to better serve important customer features (time, speed, cost) on a scalable platform to enable better features. Proposed the utilization of the shopper app and proposed an OCR-NLP program that can extract key nutritional, ingredient, and other general product information along with a timestamp and location ping. This data would then be preprocessed in our pipeline and integrated with Instacart's primary feature set (availability of products in stock, nutritional content and personalized recommendations, Instacart advertisement, catalogue management for new/changed items, composite maps for locating products in stores based on most recent pings). Developed ideas and pitched final winning submission, Instacart in talks of potential implementation.

**BLUESKY Project ‚Üí** Reinventing traditional mental health services by creating a series of pluggable tools to better assist patients with identifying sources and insights in health data [Feb 2021 - May 2021]

Ensemble Learner for Identifying LiveTime mood and emotion for increasing touch points and access to mental health services. Uses NLP and sensitivity coefficients to first identify nuances in patient audio, facial, and contextual data in the form of "journal video logs". Through the data collected, an ensemble of audio and facial sentiment analysis algorithms that utilize recurrent models (recurrent CNNs and LSTMs) to map sentiment predictions based on mood at a timestamp. These timestamps and changes in mood can be used to pick up nuances in patient data to identify key phrases and topics that a therapist might want to further explore. It does this using Audio Samples Sentiment Analysis through data preprocessing methods, extracting facial features and landmarks, a plugin Automatic Speech to Text Recognition algorithm built up on MFCCs, Part of Speech Tagging, and NLU, Subject Capture, and Key Phrase Recognition. The project uses a variety of these systems and models to develop a pipeline that can predict audio mood at a 55% validation accuracy and facial mood at 76% as these applications are novel with no traditional datasets available. Used several other models from GRUs to Resnets, Deep2Speech Architecture, Lexicons, and other inferencing models to draw connections between what was said, how it was said, and why it was said.

**Mechanism of Action Prediction ‚Üí** *Working on Harvard Connection Map X L1000 Dataset to Predict Mechanisms of Actions for Drugs Based on their Genetic Profile* [May 2021 - Pres.]

The goal of the model is to increase the throughput of identifying mechanisms of actions for drugs (MoA). An MoA helps doctors and researchers determine potential factors they might need to monitor for a patient when taking certain medication, identifying which drug works better at targeting specific aspects of a disease, and speed up the production of agnostics. Finding effective molecules with desirable traits can be hard especially when it comes to making mass-market products. In fact, the hinderence of discovery is making antibiotics unprofitable as bacteria are becoming increasinly resistant to traditional antibiotics while it becomes more difficult to discover antibiotics that have different MoAs to combat that resistance. Building multi-label classification model utilizing Convolution Architecture based on visualized gene expression and cell viability.

**Neuvae Research Inquiry ‚Üí** *Built a practical approach to combatting antibiotic resistance by creating a pipeline for phage engineering and immunotherapy solutions for the development of novel antibodies against bacteria* [Apr 2021 - May 2021]

As part of a deep inquiry into the problem of antibiotic resistance, my team of 5 worked on contacting experts in antibiotic research and phage therapy to develop a novel proposal for a research tract and engineering method to make phage therapy much more accessible and effective at combatting antibiotic resistance. The primary focus was increasing the range of the phage in an efficient way along with utilizing the capsid's properties to transport antibody-coding genetic material attached with antigen samples to illict an immune response against the bacteria. **Validated the solution with Canada and the US' most credible researchers in antibiotic resistance and pitched to several founders and CEOs of bringing our technical solution for production to market.
