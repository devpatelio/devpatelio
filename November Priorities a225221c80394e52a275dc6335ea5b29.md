- Previous Priorities
    
    ## **Month 1:** *Identifying Problem (September 21st ‚Üí* September 30th)
    
    <aside>
    üìÜ **Primary Goal:** Build Traction and Early Validation for Product Idea in this Focus Term Through an Altered Focus Process: **Validation = Network + Data, Traction = Results and Products**
    
    </aside>
    
    1. **Writing a Whitepaper/Proposal on the Project and Problem [**September 30th]
        
        *One Thing To Get Done:* Whitepaper proposal + send it out and get feedback from 5 people 
        
    - [ ]  Write Memo + Whitepaper proposal [analagous to abstract and intro of a research paper] regarding targeted problem stage ‚Üí Key Inspo Sources = Fusion Energy, Blockchain, etc.
        - [ ]  Need to Identify Target Market + Final Product [what is this gonna look like in its final form]
    - [ ]  Process involves collecting data to make first draft by S3 ‚Üí move onto refining the information based on what's happening in the industry right now ‚Üí find niche application area *disease
    - [ ]  Talk to 5 Researchers in Programmable Therapies and RNA Research to get Feedback on Proposal for Project [October 5th]
    - [ ]  #buildinpublic ‚Üí this means pusing out content on the problem first and foremost, clearly communicate the problem and what you're solving with a baseline of competency to researchers  [i.e. 3 articles + whitepaper by Oct. 5]
    - [ ]  Plant seeds for building credibility and support systems ‚Üí Applying for 3 main competitions/grants (Emergent Ventures App in Progress, MIT Clubs for Biotech X AI + Speaker Apps, ICES SF, etc.) ‚Üí Application Season [Sept. 30th]
    
    ## **Month 2: *Bits and Pieces (October 1st ‚Üí November 15th)***
    
    <aside>
    üèúÔ∏è **Primary Goal:** Focus on the Building Aspect and Narrow down the product approach to the problem ‚Üí continuously re-evaluate what you're trying to build with regards
    
    </aside>
    
    1. **Breaking down what the solutions fundamentally are, and what does that look like? [web portal, research paper only?, partner with lab?, etc.]**
        
        *Build the tech behind the solution + competitions/sprints for credibility* 
        
        - October 1st ‚Üí 10th: RNA Folding Micro
        - October 10th ‚Üí 21st : Protein-RNA Interactions
        - October 21st ‚Üí November 8th: Stability and Conformation + End-to-End
    - [ ]  Iterate on the solution aspect ‚Üí this is moreso a way of solving microproblems in relation to the main product + get feedback with current network base for feedback, questions, and address criticisms
    - [ ]  Log results on a substack/twitter ‚Üí enfore the #buildinpublic and keep people in the loop [weekly updates]
    - [ ]  2 microprojects that act on top of the final product (almost like the replicates, but this is done to moreso assess where my project is at + what baseline do I need to reach/break? this helps create new questions for how to improve the product and this can be demonstrated in the replicate)
    - [ ]  Organize **TEAMS** for IGEM and Imagine Cup ‚Üí moreso a way to validate microprojects and get a chance to increase focus on my work and projects + good forcing function for presentation [IN TALKS RIGHT NOW]
    - [ ]  Continue to check in with the network base + build it by having 2 new meetings every week + have a focus on getting into networking events and conferences (Harvard Drug Symposium, MIT Bioeng Meetup, etc.) [Oct 11 ‚Üí 15]
    - [ ]  Connect primarily with research labs and companies who can potentially help you out with this project ‚Üí this is where a good chunk of efforts can be focused on/you can assist to bring things to reality as a push into said target area [Oct 30th]
    - [ ]  FIND A COFOUNDER for December and Beyond [Nov 1st]
    
    ## **Month 3: *Milestone*** [Short Month Period] (*November 16th ‚Üí December 10th)*
    
    <aside>
    üóΩ **Primary Goal:** Get a final generative design paper and accompanying toolkit-based code project and submit to ISEF + Emergent Ventures Grant, Connect for the next stage of the year and project
    
    </aside>
    
    1. **Breaking down what the solutions fundamentally are, and what does that look like? [web portal, research paper only?, partner with lab?, etc.]**
        
        *Connecting with an officiator and lab to use this project and proposal as an entry to work on more exciting applications of programmable precision therapies, specifically focusing on Ribo-N-Switches*
        
    - [ ]  If labs can't be found, work with a team of cofounders to work in collaboration with this project
    - [ ]  finalize and build out everything for showcase + invite all mentors along the journey
    - [ ]  identify target market + base product off of the current bottleneck (more to come)
